# A mini server similar to Instagram 

Languages like js,css, ejs simiar to html ,node js are used.
Note: In a folder with some name "ABC" contains package.json through which we can install express ie.( node-modules and package-lock.json). In the same folder we have a file "index2Insta.js" 
Within the "ABC" folder ,We must-and-should have two more folders name as "public" and "views".
"public" folder contains two more folders named as CSSDir and JSDir, where CSSDir folder contains "style.css" and JSDir contains "app.js".
"views" folder contains "index2Insta.ejs"
This process has to be followed because, allmost every programmer follows this for representing code systematically within folders of specific names,as it could be even read by other programmers.Even code is also typed and designed accordingly
